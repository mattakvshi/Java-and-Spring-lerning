In this version of the app, we fixed the oddities with the choice of path!
Now you don't need to bother and do something, the program will install itself on the right path.
We also added the "Help" section to the program, it says how to use the application.
In addition, we solved the problem with the paths to the options, you can still change the path in the settings,
but if you don't, then nothing terrible will happen, the program will detect your desktop,
wherever it is, and make a folder "Options" there, and upload everything there.

We wish you a pleasant use!

Sincerely, EVC inc.
